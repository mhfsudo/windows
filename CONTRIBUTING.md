Every feedback and support is appreciated.

## Branching Model
I use GitLab / GitHub Flow as branching model. The default branch is main.

https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow

Below is the workflow for adding new code:
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes on this feature branch
3. Create a merge or pull request for merging feature to main
4. Delete your feature branch

## Pre-commit hooks
I use the pre-commit hook example. This is not yet devloped further.
